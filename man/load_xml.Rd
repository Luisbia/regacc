\description{
This functions loads xml files into R. We may want to do that to look at files
before loading them with FameFeed. The function will look by default on the server
folder for all countries, tables, variables and units but that can be changed by the user using
the arguments of the function. The unit multiplier is changed, if needed, to be
consistent with the one used by default elsewhere.
}
\examples{
# Load all the files waiting to be loaded to FameFeed in the server.
df<- load_xml()

# Load only table T1001.
df <- load_xml(table_sel = "T1001")

# Load all tables T1001 and T1300 for Slovenia and Luxembourg that have been loaded in Matis.
df <- load_xml(folder = "//fame2prod.cc.cec.eu.int/fame-estat/econ/REGACC/DONE",
table_sel = c("T1001","T1300"),
country_sel = c("SI", "LU"))

# Load all files loaded in Matis between 2021-12-22 2022-01-02 and consolidate them.
df <- load_xml(folder = "//fame2prod.cc.cec.eu.int/fame-estat/econ/REGACC/DONE",
